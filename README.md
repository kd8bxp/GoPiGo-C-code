# GoPiGo C Code

This is some of my C code for the Raspberry PI, and the GoPiGo2 board.  
follow the instructions for Dexter Industries Raspbian for Robots Image  
https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/install-raspbian-for-robots-image-on-an-sd-card/  

## Installation

Create a directory call "bin" in your home directory.  
You can copy all of your compiled programs to this directory, and there is no need to use the "./prgname".  
Follow the instructions for installing the GoPiGo library that can be found here:
